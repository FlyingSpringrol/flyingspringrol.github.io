<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This assignment was about representing geometry in three dimensions. We focused on Bezier surfaces and Meshes as our representations, working with De Casteljau subdivision and the Half-edge mesh data structure. This project was fun to do, I enjoyed just writing/drawing out my algorithms and translating them into code. It was pretty easy to debug because I had the reference in front of me when I drew it out, and I actually might start trying to do this for my other CS classes as well.

  <br/>
  I've been doing digital art for a while, and have been working with 3D geometry representations so most of the project wasn't that big of a suprise for me. The De Casteljau algorithm is quite beautiful though, just scrolling through the curve and watching t values change and the 'legs' of the algorithm draw a curve kept me entertained for a while.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

<p>The de Casteljau algorithm works by either iteratively or recursively interpolating n pairs of points into n-1 pairs of points, until a single point is evaluated. 

<br/>The evaluate_step function which I implemented only does a single step in this interpolation process. It works by populating a level in an interpolation pyramid of sorts, each level of which holds the n points that are going to be interpolated. The algorithm works by stepping up this pyramid, starting with, in the example, the six points, then interpolating to five, then four, then three, then two, then finally 1 point, which sits on the curve. The algorithm does this for every 't' value, which will determine the resolution of the curve. The actual loop doing the stepping of the pyramid and t value passing is outside of the scope of my code: again, my code only evaluates a single step at a time.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
<p>The de Castlejau algorithm can be adapted to work in 3D as well as 2D, which I implemented in this part of the project. To describe the algorithm generally, given a nxn grid of control points, you can iterate over all the u, v values of the grid, interpolating the control points at each UV coordinate to get the point on the surface. When evaluating a whole surface, the algorithm works by essentially sweeping a curve over the u,v grid, creating a surface. 
<br>
The way my algorithm works, is it takes in a single set of u,v coordinates, and evaluates a point on the surface based on those U,V coordinates. It does this by treating each row in the grid of the 4x4 control points as a set of 4 controls points on a 2D curve. It does standard de Castljau evaluation on each of these rows, using the u coordinate passed in, and compiles the result of the evaluation from each row. It then take those 4 compiled points, and performs yet another de Casteljau evaluation on them, using the v coordinate passed in. This final evaluation returns a 3D point which lies on the surface of the curve.  </p>

<br/>
<p>There were some black boxes in this part of the project that I was a bit uncomfortable with: one being the conversion from the Bezier surface to the triangle mesh, the other being the actual bezier definition of the teapot. It was a little tricky to wrap my head around how you could create a spherical bezier, but I guess the algorithm is robust enough to allow for such weird interpolation in 3D. The curve to triangle code is still a mystery to me unfortunately. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

<p>In this part I implemented smooth vertex shading. This works by assigning a normal value to each vertex: if visualized, it would look like the teapot had hair sticking out at perpendicular angles to each vertex. The end result, (without the visualized normals), is a surface that appears more smooth, as the vertices all have a normal averaged from the faces around them.

<br/>
My code accomplishes this behaviour by iterating through the vertices around the vertex (going to call this vertex Vi for simplicity), by using the halfedge data structure. The code then takes each pair of vertices, which it knows are on a shared face based on the way the halfedge structure works, and takes the cross product of the vectors made by the difference between our vertex Vi and each vertex in the pair of vertices. This process guarantees cross products pointing outwards from the faces around the vertex. The algorithm then averages all these cross products (unnormalized normal vectors of the adjacent faces), and sets the Vertex's normal to that normalized value. This results in smooth shading.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
<p>Really not that much to report about the code in this part: just reassigned every pointer involved with the flip. The debugging wasn't that hard, as I just stuck with the drawing that I made. It would prove to be the ground truth for everything, essentially all I had to do was save all the pointers I'd need, then reassign every element involved with the flip operation. 
<br/>
The pictures also weren't that interesting: there are only a couple cases you can create just by flipping normals: the 'disapearing' edge, where the edge can hide itself on the bottom of the quad, the 'stretched' edge, where it results in this weird long edge with odd normals, and the 'flipped' edge, which is the most intuitive result you get.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
<p> The code was the same kind of deal as with part 4, I just wrote everything down really really meticulously, then in code saved and reassigned all the pointers I had drawn. It was pretty simple to check if something was wrong, but just looking at the paper.
<br/>
Also, same kind of deal here with the images. You can do some interesting things with splits and flips, creating cool mosiacs, subdividing faces, and getting odd polygons. I didn't really focus on anything in particular in my image, as for part 6 to work, the flip and split behavior MUST be 100% correct.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
<p>In this part I implement smooth subdivision. This algorithm works by splitting every edge, and updating the vertex positions by using the average of its neighbors positions. 

<br/> In this part I just followed the projects recommended strategy for upsampling. Just to step through it in detail, my code first iterates through all edges and vertices in the mesh, calculating their new average positions, and storing them in the newPosition members. After this it updates all the vertex positions. It then iterate through all edges, splitting them if they are between two old vertices, and changing the newly created vertex's location to the member stored in the edge newPosition member. After this the algorithm again iterates through all edges, flipping edges if they are between an old and a new vertex. Below are some examples of a subdivided cow and quadball.</p>

<p>This algorithm is a smooth subdivision algorithm: meaning it removes hard edges. In digital art, this behaviour is super useful for organic surfaces, but is a giant pain when doing 'hard' body modeling, like on cars or buildings. The way you can get around this is by adding supporting 'edge loops' on edges, which prevents the softening of the edges. We didn't implement edge loops in the project, but splitting edges seems to help the smoothing behaviour if it is unwanted. Below is what I think showcases this behaviour the best: the smoothing of a torus with hard edges.</p>

<p>The trick to getting the cube to subdivide right was to split and flip all the edges on the cube into X shapes. This would allow the averaging operation to to behave symettrically, as the vertex positions are now also all symettric. </p>
