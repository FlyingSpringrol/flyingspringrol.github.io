<h1 align="middle"> Building an Augmented Reality Collaborative Tool On Hololens</h1>
<h3 align = "middle"> and the design lessons I took away.</h3>


<p> My friend came to me with a pretty well thought out product that he and some of his peers in the Center for Augmented Cognition had developed over the last year. In short, it was a remote telepresence application, where a user in VR would show an operator in AR how to fix a machine. The idea was a maintenance operator on an oil rig who didn't have the knowledge to fix a specific piece of equipment, could call using Pengram and an experienced operator could hop into VR and show them how to perform the necessary tasks to get it working. I was sold.  </p>

 <p> In the initial stages of this project, I had more of a supplemenatry role as a UI/UX designer, but on the side spent quite a bit time doing research to validate design assumptions and figure out if we were truly solving the problem we were saying we were solving. Spoiler. We were not. </p>

<br/>

<h3>TLDR: Things I learned </h3>
<ul> 
  <li> Talk to your users. Always, and constantly. When you don't do it, you'll just kind of drift away from the target problem you intended on solving. </li>
  <li> Read research papers: for example, VR/AR has been around for 60 years, and there are thousands upon thousands of experiments that have been done and published. Save yourself work :). </li>
  <li> Hololens usability is a huge issue, when building for it consider UI learning factors, device, weight, battery length, price. Think of it as a demo tool, not a industry ready device. </li>
  <li> Key feature of AR seems to be novelty: it seems almost magical to the new user. </li>
</ul>

</ul>


<p> This is my favorite piece of the research, spent the most time on it, and I think it captured the state of AR instructions pretty well. </p>

  While in this stage of the project, my contributions were mainly from a strategy and business angle: but I did do some visual work to polish up the user experience before some important presentations. The first thing I was brought on to do was design a virtual tool that could allow a user to grab things, but also draw. Previously, the tool had been a giant red ball attached to the persons hand, but I designed a type of wrist based hand-tool that satisfied the design constraints.

<p>They also needed me to design an environment for the VR side of their telepresence application. I came up with an infinite grid like structure, under a nice sky.
I based this design mostly off the Oculus Medium design blog.

            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>

The original operator avatar was literally a ball with a cube stuck in it's head, so I went around to fixing that as well. Realizing we didn't have the budget to create an animated avatar with articulated eyes or a face, I decided to design one that had a headset over the eyes to avoid this issue. 
</p>

        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>

<p> In this time, the core founding members would take the project to Microsoft's imagine cup, winning first place at U.S nationals, and going on to worlds. </p>
<p> At the same time, what really stuck out to me about the product and it's scalability was not the live telepresence aspect, which had a host of problems such as networking issues, video issues and most importantly, a need for incredibly accurate 3D models: but rather it was the app's ability to record telepresence. The promise of recording teachers and operators in a way which captured hand gestures and 3D motion was incredibly compelling to me. I spent a couple weeks building a prototype for the Lawrence Hall of Science to test out the idea. I downloaded some satellite models from the NASA website and recorded an educational series for them. I still think there was something interesting here. Alas, at the point we were making the mistake of optimizing for venture capital and awards, which definitely mislead us a bit . <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ-I3NvwaOI&feature=youtu.be"> Link to the video</a> </p>
