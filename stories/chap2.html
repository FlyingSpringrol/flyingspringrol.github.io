<h1 align="middle"> Building an Augmented Reality Collaborative Tool On Hololens</h1>
<h3 align = "middle"> and the design lessons I took away.</h3>

<p> Heres the video link to this final Oculus/Hololens based telepresence application.</p>
<a href = "https://vimeo.com/306606742"> Video </a>

<p> Project abstract: I led product development for my friends startup, and we would eventually a) win Microsoft's Imagine cup in 2018, b) get a research poster published at ISAM 2019, and c) turn it all into a company and get the backing of YCombinator in 2019. </p>


<br/>

<h3>TLDR: General design principles</h3>
<ul> 
  <li> Talk to your users. Always, and constantly.</li>
  <li> Read research papers: for example, VR/AR has been around for 60 years, and there are thousands upon thousands of experiments that have been done and published. Save yourself work. </li>
</ul>
<h3>TLDR: General Hololens design principles</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Hololens usability is a huge issue, always consider UI learning factors, device, weight, battery length, price. Think of it as a demo tool, not a industry ready device. </li>
  <li> Key feature: Novelty of AR: it seems almost magical to the new user. </li>
</ul>

</ul>


<p> This is my favorite piece of the research, spent the most time on it, and I think it captured the state of AR instructions pretty well. </p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Brought on as Product Designer</h2>

<p>
  After leaving PantheonVR my friend approached me with a VR/AR problem of his own.
The startup he was working on, built out of Berkeley’s Center for Augmented Cognition, had started to have VR design issues. 
</p>
<p>
  They needed some better interaction paradigms. I agreed: their main interaction tool was an enormous red sphere attached to a hand. 
</p>
<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/hand1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p> They need me to design a tool that would allow for several things. Not one to back down from a design challenge, especially with VR, I said yes. </p>
<h3> The constraints were: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Needed a constraint for the hand that wouldn’t impede grabbing </li>
  <li> The tool needed to be able to draw and paint. </li>
  <li> I designed a type of ‘hand gun’, something that would allow for both intuitive grabbing, as well as drawing, painting, and other tool use. 
  </li>
</ul>
<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/hand2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p>They also needed me to design an environment for the VR side of their telepresence application. I came up with an infinite grid like structure, under a nice sky.
I based this design mostly off the Oculus Medium design blog.
</p>
<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/grid1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p> 
They also wanted me to improve their avatars, so I came up with a better design for the floating avatar.
</p>
<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/operator1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p> I added more definition to the head, and added a headset to the operator.  
</p>

<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/operator3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p> I added a wireframe to the avatar, to add a more futuristic look. </p>

<div align = "middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <img src="chap2/operator4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>
<p> In this time, the core founding members would take the project to Microsoft's imagine cup, winning first place at U.S nationals, and going on to worlds. </p>
