<p> This project was for my Undergraduate Research, under professor Luisa Caldas. I was in charge of the technical aspects of the project for the first year. I prototyped several iterations of AR ideas, driving the technical decisions before we landed on ARKit as our primary medium. The fun part of this project was working with the team of architects that Luisa brought on. Architects tend to think about 3D space in a really interesting way, which is incredibly ideal when trying to make things in the inherently spatial mediums of AR and VR. The project itself was pretty straighforward: augment an architectural model with AR content to tell a compelling story. The interesting design challenge was how to create such an experience with minimal user onboarding. We ended up finding that creating a sequence of QR code styled AR Markers, and using those as "checkpoints" into the experience was the single most effective way of getting people to move around, re-scan and localize the model. </p>

<h3>TLDR: General design principles for mobile AR</h3>
<ul> 
  <li>Design your experience around drifting models, (more details below).</li>
 <li> iPads are heavy: more than five minutes of holding them up gets hard. </li>
 <li> The "magical moments" of AR happen when you encourage users to move in physical space.</li>
 <li> The most immersive AR is augmenting an existing object: use markers to create known links between the physical and digital worlds you create. </li>
 <li> AR is still very novel, which is good and bad. Good because people are interested in it, bad because theresâ€™ potentially a bunch of onboarding you have to do.</li>
</ul>
<h3> TLDR: Technical approaches we developed to solve design and development processes </h3>
<ul> 
  <li>
  Build re-scans of image markers into your narrative to get users to move and experience AR as it should be. Furthermore, this allows you to  get the user to realign the model for you. </li>
  <li> 3D scan your physical model, so you can design digital content in unity around the known locations</li>
</ul>
<h3> General Things I wished I had known going into the project </h3>
<ul> 
  <li>Do your best to understand SLAM/VIO (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping + Visual Inertial Odometry) and how these affect your AR application. Understanding basic computer vision concepts like SIFT and feature tracking is also super helpful in designing your full AR experience. </li>
</ul>
